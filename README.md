# WatchOS-Soundpack

Pretty WatchOS sounds for iOS!


I have always liked the WatchOS sounds, thus, here they are for iOS!
In this repository, you can see what exactly what is in the package, and the .deb itself.

# Install

You can install this package using any working .deb package manager for iOS, however I prefer to use "CyDown", as it allows you to open and install the .deb file through Cydia, directly from this Github.

To do that: 
1) Download CyDown through Cydia
2) Navigate to this github Repository in Safari
3) Select the .deb file
4) Click "Open Binary File"
5) The package will open with CyDown, it's pretty self-explainatory thereon.
6) Go to the Winterboard settings pane, enable, and respring. :)

# Issues & Depends

1) You must already have Winterboard or Anemone installed (to apply the theme)
2) Currently, there are only the Lock and Charge sounds present. More to come if people are interested!
3) I can't seem to change SMS sounds.

# Thanks!

Thanks so much to /u/Wh0ba for teaching me how to do this! :-)
